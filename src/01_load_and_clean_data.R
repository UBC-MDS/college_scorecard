# Author: Sarah Watts
# Date: January 2019
#
# This scripts loads data originating from:
# https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2018-19/DSCI_532_viz-2_students/blob/master/oversized_datasets/scorecard.csv
# Saved in this repo as: "data/01_A_oversized_scorecard.csv"
# -------------------------------
# This script loads a subset of data originating from:
# https://ed-public-download.app.cloud.gov/downloads/Most-Recent-Cohorts-All-Data-Elements.csv
# Saved in this repo as: "data/01_B_subset_recent_scorecard.csv"
# -------------------------------
# The following operations are performed on the loaded datasets:
#    1. These two datasets are stored as tidy dataframes and joined
#    2. Only the values: UNITID, STABBR, loan_ever, female, age_entry, md_faminc, 
#                        md_earn_wne_p10, UGDS, ADM_RATE
#       are retained. 
#    3. Universities where UGDS (number of undergraduate students) = Null are removed
#    4. Add a column for "school size" based on: 
#           Large school: 15,000 +
#           Medium school: 5,000-15,000
#           Small school: 0-5,000
# columns needed for the scorecard.csv shiny app
# Its output is a clean csv file (scorecard_clean.csv)
