### Milestone 1

#### Description of your app & sketch

The app contains a landing page that shows the average or count of our dataset factors (number of students, financial aid, average family income, post education income) broken down by ethnic group (white, black, asian, hispanic) in the US in bar charts. From a dropdown list, users are able to filter based on state, school and year. Users can also hover over bars in the bar charts to get the exact values for each ethnic group.

An example sketch is shown below:
